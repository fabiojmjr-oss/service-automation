# This target exists because the alternative failed twice: running the linter but forgetting
# the formatter, and running a locally installed tool older than the one CI installs. Both
# produced a red build on a change that was correct.
#
# Everything goes through `python -m` so the tools always come from the interpreter holding the
# project's dependencies, rather than from whatever happens to be first on PATH.
